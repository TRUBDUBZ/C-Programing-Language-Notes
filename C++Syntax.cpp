#include <iostream> //header file library
using namespace std; // using standard library
                     

int main() { // main function
  cout << "Hello World \n"; // first object
  cout << "Learn C++ \n\n"; // second object with blank line
  cout << "Educative Team"; // third object
  return 0; // no other output or return 
  } // end of code
    

// #include <iostream> is a header file library. A header file imports features into your program. Weâ€™re basically asking that the program copy the content from a file called <iostream>. This stands for input and output stream, and it defines the standards for the objects in our code.

// using namespace std means that we are using object and variable names from the standard library (std). This statement is often abbreviated with the keyword std and the operator ::. The int main ( ) is used to specify the main function.

// It is a very important part of C++ programs. A function essentially defines an action for your code. Anything within the curly brackets { } will be executed.

// cout is an object (pronounced see - out). In this example, it defines our outputs: the strings of words. We write a new object using cout on the second line. The character \n makes the text execute on a different line.

// Including two \n\n creates a blank space. By writing return 0, we are telling the program that nothing will return. We are only outputting strings of text. Note that we use the << operator to name our objects. The semi colon ; functions like a period.
