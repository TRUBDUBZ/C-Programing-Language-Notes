# Comparisons

// You can check if two values are equal == (notice there are double =s to check for equivalency rather than the single symbol used for assignment), not equal !=, greater than >, greater than or equal >=, less than <, and less than or equal <=.

// As an example, if you wanted to perform a segment of code if a had the same value as b, you could write it as:

int a = 3;
int b = 3;
if (a == b) {
a++;
}
