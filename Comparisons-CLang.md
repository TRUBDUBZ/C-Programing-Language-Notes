# Comparisons

- You can check if two values are equal == (notice there are double =s to check for equivalency rather than the single symbol used for assignment), not equal !=, greater than >, greater than or equal >=, less than <, and less than or equal <=.

- As an example, if you wanted to perform a segment of code if a had the same value as b, you could write it as:

`int a = 3;`
`int b = 3;`
`if (a == b) {`
`a++;`
`}`
