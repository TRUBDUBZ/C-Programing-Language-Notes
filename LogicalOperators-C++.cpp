# Logical Operators

- You do not just have to check one part at a time when you are doing your comparisons. C lets you see if two or more parts are true, if at least one is true, or if something is not true.

- If you are checking to see if two or more parts are true you can use && between them. If you want to see if any of the parts is true you can use ||. To see both in action here is a trivial example:
