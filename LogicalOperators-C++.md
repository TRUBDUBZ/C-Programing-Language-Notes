# Logical Operators

- You do not just have to check one part at a time when you are doing your comparisons. C lets you see if two or more parts are true, if at least one is true, or if something is not true.

-  We have already seen a quick example with !=, checking to see if the left side is not equal to the right side, but ! in front of any boolean will see if the statement is not true. 

- You will learn more about this when you learn about boolean statements in general.

- If you are checking to see if two or more parts are true you can use && between them. If you want to see if any of the parts is true you can use ||. To see both in action here is a trivial example:
