# Mathematical Operations

- At their core, computers are basically fancy calculators. So it’s a good thing to learn how to perform basic mathematical operations early on in your language development.
- Addition and subtraction work just as you would expect them to. a = 2 + 3 will store 5 in the variable a. You can also use these variables as part of the math (or all of it).

`int a = 2;`
`int b = 3;`
`int c = a + b;`

- These same foundational principles of mathematics hold true for subtraction, multiplication, and division.
