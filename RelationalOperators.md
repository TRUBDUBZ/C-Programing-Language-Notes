# Relational Operators

- When writin conditional statements, sometimes we need to use different types of operators to compare values, These operators are called *relational operators*

- To have a condition we need relational operators:
    
    - ==        equal to
    - !=        not equal 
    - >         Greater than
    - <         Less than
    - >=        greater than or equal 
    - <=        less than or equal
    
- Relational Operators compare the value on the left with the value on the right.
